# transcend_game
A text based game that follows a soul as it escapes from life and death.

Currently working on getting game to function as OOP style game with multiple Classes, import functions and keeping a record of where the player is and has been using a tally system that will trigger responses based on how player is doing.

Goal is to consolodate and simplify after things work.
